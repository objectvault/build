# Docker Environment Builder

Scripts to Build Test Environment(s) for the Application using docker.

You can also use this as an example of how to build an environment for other systems.

## Development OS

The script was developed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
In theory it should executable on other Linux distributions.

## Usage

To run the application, in more or less, debug mode, just type:

```shell
./run start all 
```
